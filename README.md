# Hello there 😁

My name is Robert and I am a graduate of the National & Kapodistrian University of Athens with a BSc in Economics (2018-2023).  
Currently I am fullfilling my dream of becoming an Electronic Engineer in the department of Computer Science and Engineering  
at the University of West Attica (2023- ).

I am particularly interested in 👀:  
• `Programming Languages` (I really enjoy learning new ones)  
• `Electronic & Microelectronic circuits`  
• `Digital Electronics and Logic Design`  
• `Microcontrollers`  

As long term goals I would also like to learn 🎯:  
• `Proper Soldering`  
• `and how to Diagnose and (possibly) Repair faulty Hardware`  

Here I will be uploading the projects and assignments I complete during my undergraduate years.  
Each course will be found in its own repository.
